                <p>Coming from a competitive background, I hold a mindset geared towards growth, always eager to better myself in every aspect. The discovery of logic, programming, and the countless challenges to solve and skills to develop has ignited a true passion for full stack web development and general programming. The blend of creativity, logic, and technology, along with the endless exploration, fuels my excitement and dedication to web development. Outside of my professional interests, I'm passionate about staying active, thriving in competitive environments, and delving into learning a new skill.</p>
